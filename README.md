# python-challenge
In this challenge, I completed 2 challenges using python.
In the first challenge, I analyzed a fictional company's finances by reviewing month over month profits and losses to determine the total profits, the average monthly change in profits, and the best & worst months for the company.

In the second challenge, I analyzed the results of a fictional election by determining the total vote count of the election, the % of votes received by candidate, & ultimately the winner of the election.

The results of both analyses can be found it the txt files stored in this repository.
